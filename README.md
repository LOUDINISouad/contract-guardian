# Contract Guardian

Contract Guardian is a cutting-edge tool utilizing machine learning to automatically classify smart contracts as safe or potentially malicious. This tool is designed to elevate the security and dependability of smart contract development by offering an automated classification system.

## Installation

Before diving into Contract Guardian, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). 

Once Python is installed, it's essential to add the Python executable path to your system's PATH environment variable. This step enables you to run Python commands from any directory without specifying the full path to the Python executable.

To keep your package manager for Python, pip, up to date, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

To install [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) packages use the following command:
```bash
py -m pip install tiktoken
```

To install [Scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) packages use the following command:
```bash
py -m pip install scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To initiate the Contract Guardian program, use the following command:

```bash
py main.py
```

This command executes the main Python script (`main.py`) and kicks off the Contract Guardian tool. Ensure that you're in the correct directory containing the `main.py` file before running the command.
